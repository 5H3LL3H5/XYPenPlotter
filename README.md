# XY Pen Plotter UI #

This is a Qt Creator project with the UI for the XY Pen Plotter Demo
first showed by Toradex at the Embedded World 2014.

To compile this project, you need Qt Creator 3.0 as well as a suitable
cross compile environment. The Toradex Developer website contains more
information how to setup such an environment:

Up to four SVG files located in /var/cache/xypenplotter/ are picked up
by the application and shown on screen.

The provided SVG is a good example which works well with the Pen
Plotter.
